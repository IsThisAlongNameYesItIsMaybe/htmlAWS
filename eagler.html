  <p> After you have downloaded the file, go to your files app.</p>
  
  <p>When the files app is open, go to the recent tab or search to find file downloaded. (The file should end in .zip)</p>
  <p>Right click on the file, and decompress it. A folder should be created and there should be 1 file in the folder. 
  <p>If you see a file in the folder that ends in .html, double-click it and your g4me should open.</p>
  <p>I threw this together kinda fast, so it's pretty bad.</p>
